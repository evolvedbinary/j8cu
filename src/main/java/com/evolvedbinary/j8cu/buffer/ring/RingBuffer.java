/**
 * Implementation of a Ring Buffer
 * (e.g. Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer">Circular Buffer</a>).
 * <p>This implementation supports two modes of operations for reading from the buffer:
 *  <ol>
 *      <li>1. Unordered (the default)</li>
 *      <li>2. Ordered</li>
 *  </ol>
 * The difference between Unordered and Ordered modes is that when you use Unordered mode,
 * it starts reading from the start of the buffer, whilst Ordered mode starts reading from the
 * oldest entry in the buffer.
 * Ordered mode is useful for when you want to keep a buffer of the most recent N objects,
 * and you need to read them back from oldest to newest.
 *
